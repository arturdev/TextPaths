# TextPaths

**TextPaths** is an utility for converting `NSAttributedText` to vector representation where each character of an input text is represented as a `CGPAth` glyph. **TextPaths** also returns typographic propeties for lines and entire text flow.

Source `NSAttributedText` is converted into a tree like representation with char glyphs on leafs.

```
 TextPath
    ⎿ TextPathFrame[]
        ⎿ TextPathLine[]
            ⎿ TextPathGlyph[]

    ⎿ ComposedTextPath
```

`TextPathFrame` - text frame representation

`TextPathLine` - single text line representation

`TextPathGlyph` - single character representation (glyph)

`ComposedTextPath` - composed path of entire input text
